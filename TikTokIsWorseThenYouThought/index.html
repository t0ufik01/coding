        <h3>TikTok addiction</h3>
        <p>
          <div>For most people, TikTok is a harmless distraction from everyday life but for others, it can become as addictive.</div>
          <br>
          <div>Dr. Julia Albright, digital sociologist, and lecturer at the University of Southern California (USC), explains that TikTok has adopted the same principles that have made gambling addictive. In psychological terms, it’s known as ‘random reinforcement’ (sometimes you win, sometimes you lose – just like a slot machine) which is how platforms like TikTok are designed.</div>
          <br>
          <div>Dr. Albright says that in a sense she got addicted to TikTok the first time she used it. She started watching 15 seconds videos one afternoon and totally lost track of time:</div>
          <br>
          <q><strong>When you’re scrolling … sometimes you see a photo or something that’s delightful and it catches your attention. And you get that little dopamine hit in the brain … in the pleasure center of the brain. So, you want to keep scrolling</strong></q>
          <br>
          <div>It’s not just watching video content that causes the brain to release good-feeling neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin, when a TikTok user gets a like, comment, share, save, view, or follow, it can release the same feelings of euphoria. </div>
          <br>
          <div>Over time the brain becomes reliant on this type of stimulation to induce pleasure and it needs more and more TikTok videos and engagement to get the same rush of excitement.</div>
          <br>
          <div>Undoing the damage done to the brain because of TikTok and other social media addictions can take months to correct and even lead to addiction.</div>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          <div>In conclusion, TikTok addiction is a growing concern among users, as it can lead to negative effects such as social isolation, lack of sleep, and decreased productivity. While the app's algorithm and the pressure to be constantly connected to social media can contribute to addiction, there are also ways to manage it.</div> 
          <br>
          <div>Setting limits on the amount of time spent on the app, finding healthier hobbies and activities, and seeking professional help if necessary, can all help to address this problem. Remember, the key is moderation and being aware of your usage. It's important to use these platforms in a healthy way to fully benefit from the positive aspects they can bring. It's important to be aware of the risks and take steps to manage them if necessary.</div>
