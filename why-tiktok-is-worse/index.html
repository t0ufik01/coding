    <h1>TikTok is worse than you thought!</h1>
    <h2><li>What's TikTok</li></h2>

    <p class="highlight">
    TikTok, known as “Douyin” in its home market, was launched in China in September 2016. 
    It quickly started to gain traction in China and parent company ByteDance
    launched an international version the following year.
    Originally launched as a short-form video-sharing platform, primarily for lipsyncing and dancing videos, 
    TikTok has grown into a fully-fledged video service, with content available for all types of viewers
    </p>
    <h2><li>Who uses TikTok</li></h2>
 <article>   
    <p>
        There are currently one billion users worldwide, more than 100 million in the United States and 23 million in the UK.
        TikTok is banned in nine countries: China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Jordan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and USA. 
        on various grounds, including the promotion of indecency and cyberbullying. 
        Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is the only permitted version in China. 
        In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, TikTok has banned new Russian posts and live streams.
    </p>   
    <p>
        TikTok is most popular with teenage females aged 10 to 19 who account for 16.4% of active users in the US. 
        Females aged 30 to 39 were the second largest group, representing 13.8% of users. Across all age groups, the female/male split is approximately 60%/40%.    
    </p>

    <h2><li>Why is TikTok so popular?</li></h2>
 <article>   
    <p>
        The main reason why TikTok is so popular is apparent as soon as you open the app. Unlike other social platforms, 
        the first thing you see isn’t a feed of your friends’ posts, but a button called ‘For You’. 
        It offers the type of content you want to see using an algorithm based on videos you’ve watched or interacted with previously. And it never runs out of content.
    </p>
    <p>
        The short videos available on TikTok can cause viewers to lose hours of their day to the platform. 
        Data shared by TikTok in January 2022 revealed that the average user spends one hour and 25 minutes on the platform every day
        and opens the app to watch videos 17 times a day. Many users spend far longer on the platform.
    </p>

    <h2><li>What makes TikTok so addictive?</li></h2>
  <article>  
    <p>
        For most people, TikTok is a harmless distraction from everyday life but for others it can become as addictive as drugs or alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Dr. Julia Albright, digital sociologist and lecturer at University of Southern California (USC), 
        explains that TikTok has adopted the same principles that have made gambling addictive. In psychological terms, 
        it’s known as ‘random reinforcement’ (sometimes you win, sometimes you lose – just like a slot machine) which is how platforms like TikTok are designed.
    </p>
    <p class="quote"><strong>
        “When you’re scrolling … sometimes you see a photo or something that’s delightful and it catches your attention. 
        And you get that little dopamine hit in the brain … in the pleasure center of the brain. So, you want to keep scrolling.”
    </strong></p>
    <p>
        It’s not just watching video content that causes the brain to release good-feeling neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin.
    </p> 
    <p>
        When a TikTok user gets a like, comment, share, save, view, or follow, it can release the same feelings of euphoria. 
        Over time the brain becomes reliant on this type of stimulation to induce pleasure 
        and it needs more and more TikTok videos and engagement to get the same rush of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Undoing the damage done to the brain because of TikTok and other social media addiction can take months to correct and even lead to addiction.
