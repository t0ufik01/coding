                    TikTok, known as “Douyin” in its home market, is the most popular social media apps in the world, was launched in China in September 2016. It quickly started to gain traction in China and parent company ByteDance launched an international version the following year. 
                    <br><br>
                    Originally launched as a short-form video-sharing platform, primarily for lipsyncing and dancing videos, TikTok has grown into a fully-fledged video service, with content available for all types of viewers.
                    <div class="quote"><strong style="font-size: 14px;">“The roots of Education are bitter but the fruit is sweet”</strong></div>

                    <br><br>
                    Of course, some videos might not capture the attention of some people and that's why TikTok's algorithm learns and adapts to show a person the most stimulating types of videos which usually are less than 10 seconds long.

            <h2><li>TikTok addiction</li></h2>
            <p>
                <div>
                    For most people, TikTok is a harmless distraction from everyday life but for others, it can become as addictive.
                    <br>
                    Dr. Julia Albright, digital sociologist, and lecturer at the University of Southern California (USC), 
                    explains that TikTok has adopted the same principles that have made gambling addictive. In psychological terms, it’s known as ‘random reinforcement’ 
                    (sometimes you win, sometimes you lose – just like a slot machine) which is how platforms like TikTok are designed.
                    <br>
                    Dr. Albright says that in a sense she got addicted to TikTok the first time she used it. 
                    She started watching 15 seconds videos one afternoon and totally lost track of time:
                    <div class="quote"><strong style="font-size: 14px;">“When you’re scrolling … sometimes you see a photo or something that’s delightful and it catches your attention. 
                        And you get that little dopamine hit in the brain … in the pleasure center of the brain. So, you want to keep scrolling.”
                    </strong></div>
                    It’s not just watching video content that causes the brain to release good-feeling neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin, when a TikTok user gets a like, comment, share, save, view, or follow, it can release the same feelings of euphoria. 
                    Over time the brain becomes reliant on this type of stimulation to induce pleasure and it needs more and more TikTok videos and engagement to get the same rush of excitement. 
                    <br>
                    Undoing the damage done to the brain because of TikTok and other social media addictions can take months to correct and even lead to addiction.
